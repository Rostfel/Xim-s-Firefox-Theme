This is my original theme for Firefox browser, it uses userContent.css to change how newtab page looks. You can copy bookmarklet javascript code and paste it in bookmarklet URL to have button for changing backgrounds more efficiently.

Features:
-custom background (I use pixel art gif created by kirokaze)
-bigger icons
-bookmarklet javascript code for changing backgrounds

Installation:
-Theme
1. Type about:support in URL and open user profile folder.
2. In this folder create folder "chrome".
3. Use git clone in chrome folder to copy repository files.
4. Done.
-Bookmark
1. Copy code from bookmarklet_changebackground.js
2. After installing theme in browser right click on bookmark panel and create new bookmark.
3. Change name and paste into URL copied javascript code.
4. Done.
(Now when you press bookmark you can choose which image to use, then you need to rewrite background.gif, path for background logged in console.)
